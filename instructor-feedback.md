# Exceeds spec

## [ ] The analysis produces the expected output
My figure was produced in a professional way. I not only replicated it correclty, but I also went beyond and made it even better. The choices of lines in the original graph made it hard to see so I added my own colors to it. I also made a function to not make the code super long and easy to digest.

## [ ] At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file
I refactored my themes in my ggplot and added a function that makes loading in libraries easier. My function for my ggplot theme made my long code chunk a smaller more polished version. My function for loading in libraries will save future editors on this script or other scripts that use it time. They wont have to manually type library() for every single package they use. In addition I also added a roxygen skelleton to both functions that shows what the parameters are and what they stand for. I also provided examples of how it can be implemented into code.

# Collaboration

In 3-4 sentences, describe how your participation in peer feedback went. Give examples for how you were thorough and constructive.

My participation in the peer feed back was actually alot better than I thought it would be. I got alot of help from Leela when she peer reviewed my repo. she even added a vline and helped me change the title position on my plots. I was able to merge her edits into my code. I peer reviewed Jay's repo. Luckily I was able to be helpful to her. I made a separate script for her data cleaning and added the code to save the cleaned CSV to a folder in her repo, so she could use it in her analysis. She merged my edits!

-   <https://github.com/austinmartinez12/eds214-day1-tasks1/issues/16> I added my flow chart and explained how my analysis worked in my readme.

-   [https://github.com/austinmartinez12/eds214-day1-tasks1/issues/1](https://github.com/austinmartinez12/eds214-day1-tasks1/issues/15){.uri} I added this script (install.packages.R) it is in my supporting code.

-   <https://github.com/austinmartinez12/eds214-day1-tasks1/issues/11> I just did this cleaned_data that has cleaned data CSVs and my figure in a fig sub folder.
